Plumps without a strong burn and has a lasting effect. Beautiful shade as well.', 'It gives a nice tingly feeling and has my lips feeling smooth plump and soft. I see you MAC!', \"First off, the smell of the gloss is amazing sort of like cake but not too overbearing. But the downsides are that it is sort of like a stick of glue in that it's a bit sticky. So the feeling of it, especially on your mouth, can be uncomfortable. Additionally, it does a have a slight sheen/gloss but it's barely there which some may like. I did not mind. However, it has a purple tint which may look unappealing on a place like your mouth. People may see purple lips and think your sick or something. Lastly, it kind of melts when you put it onto your skin unlike lipstick, which kind of causes you to put on *too much product at once.\", \"I got the red looking tube. I was really excited to try this product as I am a big Mac fan, but it was left to be disappointing. The tube comes in a bright packaging, so I was expecting the colors to also be as vibrant but once I applied it, it was dull and left more to be desired. Overall, the plumbing effect only happened once I thought a slight tingle, and there wasn't much plumping. The look up the glass stick was not the best, and I didn't flatter me or my complexion at all.\", \"I love how compact this lip product is. It's so easy to use and glided on like butter. And give a great plump without being to uncomfortable\", 'I Love this product that I got to test as a free sample from MAC. I is so smooth to the touch with application. I was a bit nervous at first because I thought the purple color would not look right on me. However, it was very translucent in color and the smooth feeling is like one I have never had before. It was also very light on my lips and I forgot about having it on after a while. I also like the little tingle I felt when I put it on.', \"I'm a little upset with this one. It's not what I was expecting. It says non sticky and it was very sticky. Also any amount of pressure breaks the gloss. Mine is done for and I just got it yesterday :( not worth the cost.\", 'Great product it literally does everything but plump!', \"The plumping effect paired with the shiny and glossy finish gives the lips the juiciest look! I'm obsessed with how plump they look while not being over the top or uncomfortable. The tingling sensation is quite manageable imo. The only con is that the formula gets quite soft with the warmth of the lips so be careful not to twist up to much product or it can get messy.\", \"The case is beautiful and has a big mirror which is good. The colors are nice however they don't seem to match therefore may not look good together on the eyelid. There is good pigmentation to it but in order for it to actually pop on my skin tone it needs to be applied multiple times.\", \"The colors were good on the palette but, since I am black I need to pack on the shadow because it won't show up then. A little chalky like but layering helps.\", \"The colors are bombing great!\\nSo pretty!\\nBut the pigmentation thought doesn't make the colors be that great on your eyes… if you what better results with the coloring you have to wet your brush before applying it!\\nBut when you do this sometimes you eyes get caked!\\nSo it's a no for me!\", 'I love the strong beautiful bold colors to match my personality and I rather stand out then to blend in a crowd', 'I just want to start off and say thank you to MAC Cosmetics for the free Connect in Colour Eye Shadow Palette in exchange for my honest review.\\nI must say that the packaging is beautiful. I love how bright these colors are. They are super pigmented and very easy to blend out. They have a velvety feel and are long lasting! I must say that Starry Night is by far my favorite shade.

I really think these colors show really well on my complexion (medium brown skin tone) I definitely recommend using a concealer to really make the colors pop more but even alone they have a nice tone. I think this specific palette has a nice range of colors overall I would recommend.\", 'This mac eyeshadow palette is beautiful. The color are gorgeous, the packaging is really high quality. the mirror is so clear and big. The eyeshadow is pigmented, colorful and has a variety of mattes, shimmers and Metallics.

The packaging was also so nice and felt heavy and good quality.\\nI love this MAC palette shades!', \"I was gifted the Connect in Colour in exchange for my honest review. This palette has a fun color story with bright colors to create a fun look but also some warm tones that can be used for everyday. Very versatile and the consistent MAC quality we know and love.

It's a unique palette that will add to your collection!\", 'This palette has beautiful colors to work with. Easy to blend and perfect for a summer day look and even for a night look.

I made a quick and beautiful eye look using approximately three shades. This is a nude palette I didn't know I needed.\", 'I love this palette! First, I am a huge fan of neutrals and pink shades, so this palette is exactly what I would choose. I took this with me on a recent vacation and it was the only one I needed. So many different combos that I was still able to get a different look everyday even within the same color group. The shadows are super blendable and I was able to use my fingers for quick application on some days and bruises when I had more time to apply. Both looked great. Wore all day no creasing and looked amazing at the end of long day even in heat and humidity. Even lasted through beach day!', \"Love this color combo. The pink is so soft and sweet for spring and summer. Can easily build the color saturation and make it more sultry. Great for travel if you want something small but can build multiple looks with one palette. I've always loved MAC shadows. The pigment is buttery, saturated, blends smoothly, and feels almost like a soft press. I think the pigment is more finely milled than previous formulas.\", 'This palette is gorgeous, the shades go on so smooth and last all day. Everything in one palette for a complete look.

Would definitely recommend!', 'This pallette is simply perfect in every way! I love the color selection.  I can go from natural to sleek all in the same day by adding the smokey colors.

For reference I am NC50 in Studio Fix Fluid and NW45 in Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation so I am a chocolate girl with honey blonde hair. I used Soft Ochre Paint Pot all over my eyes and Born to Beam Paint Pit to make that pretty gold shade Data Mode pop and also used Its Fabstract Paint Pot on my outer V to really deepen up Overnight Influencer which is that pretty deep blue green like shade. I used all of the shades except the Olive one which I will be using in a later makeup session. I even filled my brows in with Its Fabstract too and they look really nice too because you can build the intensity to fit your preference . I wore this with gold deposit and cherish lipstick with boldly bare lip pencil and chestnut lip pencils. So so pretty and I highly recommend this palette. You can do so many looks with this one and the colors blended well an easy to work with!!!!', \"Love the colors for an everyday look, unfortunately some of the colors mainly the ones with a little sparkle were very patchy. I'm not sure if maybe it was just the pallet I received,  it some of the colors were definitely a fail while others were a hit.\", 'Love the earthy glowy tones. can create mulitple looks', \"This palette was great to use on trips,or when you're on the go, it's so compacted fits perfect in a small bag orluggage. The shades are a great combination of mattes and glitters, great for a day to night look. Loved how long lasting and buildable the shades are.\", 'Good eyeshadow. Nice pigmentation.', \"If MAC is known for anything it's their inclusivity for decades. Being richly melanated it is an amazing feeling knowing that MAC will always have deep bold pigmented products with long lasting payoff. The quality of this palate is like a work of art unique and beautiful. The case is not only gorgeous but the shadows are excellent. It's great having art that I can use to make art.\", \"Such a great eyeshadow palette! The mattes are smooth and are easy to blend and buildable. The shimmers offer high pigment with one swipe. It's easy to get a full glam look with these shadows. Not super beginner friendly since they're so pigmented.\", \"This is an awesome palette for someone who does a really simple eye look everyday. It has everything you need for day to day makeup. The size of the palette is lovely for travel or even to have on the go. It's a nice sturdy palette that's also pretty.

I normally do not wear makeup, but seeing the colors definitely made me excited to see what I could do! I was surprised at how a beginner like myself could still have a really great look! The palette is easy to use, very pigmented colors, and not a hassle if you need to take it when traveling!', \"It's a good palette, just not very good colors. I think some of the color choices felt out of place. Also, the really blush pink was so packed in the pan. It wouldn't transfer on my brush.\", \"This Connect in Colour eyeshadow palette makes a smoky eye so easy! The shades aren't super dark but the perfect mix of purples and blacks to make a soft smoky eye. I don't use MAC often so getting this palette was such a treat!\", \"This has a good time rate for wearing it without it fading super quickly, it's smooth and pigmented on all thr colors it's also build able so definitely play around with it I definitely recommend\", 'Very beautiful palette for a Smokey eye, unfortunately some colors did not give off great pigmentation but with a little layering worked well.', \"This pallet is the cutest. I really love the packaging it comes in. The artwork on the box and actual pallet compact is very fembot, spacey, showgirl dressing room. The eyeshadows are very pigmented and soft. They last a long time even when you just do a dab. The colors aren't all something I'd use every day but I do find myself reaching for satin taupe and clear history a lot. I like that you can find single pots of individual colors on their website to replace your more used shadows. Smokey eye, grab this compact.\", \"RUN! Go grab this pallet quick. It's amazing and highly pigmented with lots of color. I will continue to use it and add more\", 'really enjoyed the palette and colors. I felt the formula on some colors was more rich than others. You can wear it every day as a natural look or night time', \"I'm insulted  12 ml for this price???\", \"Never tried MAC complexion products before, i Love how convenient and hypoallergenic this pen is. NC50 is perfect to conceal and highlight. Doesn't crease, you can build up the coverage, easy to dispense. The color blended perfectly for me. Received in exchange for review.\", \"I got matched at my local MAC and the color is perfect! It covers my blemishes and minor under eye darkness very well. Only downside is it didn't really seem waterproof like it claims. I brought it to my beach vacation as a nice on the go space saver and it definitely started to come off and transfer after one dip in the pool. Still enjoying it though!\", \"From it's designed twist and lock making it easy and safe to carry in your bag without the need to worry about it leaking, and making a mess, to it being easy and quick to apply on the go. This foundation concealer duo is actually everything it advertises to be. It gives you amazing coverage without the need to use so much product. Blends well, without creasing, giving you a flawless matte finish. The only thing that would of made it better would of been if it had an attached brush head or dabbing sponge but overall it's a new favorite that I plan to purchase when this one runs out.\\n\\nSidenote: I received this complimentary sample in exchange for an honest review.\", 'This is NOT a good match color-wise. I like the dispenser and the idea, but I need a perfect match to my skin tone.', \"I love this pen so so much! It's so convenient, I love how natural it looks and that the packaging is perfect to keep the product safe from bacteria!

MAC was the first foundation I tried in college. I modeled so we needed to have a clean base full coverage foundation so MAC was it! As for this product I received it to review and wanted to test it out a few different ways. It works well with my moisturizer and spf! It works well alone too! A must have to use everyday… I love the finish\", \"Probably one of the best concealers I've tried in the past 10 years. Doesn't crease, you can build up the coverage, easy to dispense.

If I had to pick only one make up item, when I don't have time, it's just this!\", 'The shade was a good match for me. It is perfect for setting makeup. Blurs pores well.', \"The Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur  setting powder is a nice powder for everyday use. The formula is soft and feels buttery as you blend. Over a full look, it sets with a very matte finish. Its pigment isn't very opaque on its own but it still does blur away some imperfections. I particularly like that this product comes with an applicator poof, which makes it convenient to throw in your bag for on the go touch ups. One thing about the design I thought was a little funky was the mesh cover over the loose powder, It helps with waste but doesn't easily allow for brush application. Overall this powder lives up to the MAC quality you can expect from them, I would recommend to anyone wanting to try something new.\", 'This powder was able to be used all day. But the color was wrong for me.I gave to friend who loved this MAC studio.fix', \"I received a free sample for my honest review. Truly lightweight, barely there feel. I really love the texture and that it wore well while out running errands on a hot day. Didn't cake or settle, it's almost perfect. The reason for 3 stars is that it's quite dark for being medium. I applied it with just primer to see how well it would match my regular tone and I felt like it gave me a golden sun-kissed look. I personally didn't mind but I know I would've been upset had I applied it over a full face of foundation. It's definitely worth going to a store to see which on we would best fit your tone.\", 'It was pretty good, i used it for some events at school and i also used it for my dance show i did, stayed on very well!!', \"I absolutely love this product. It made my face feel so smooth and almost gave it a blurred effect. I really like how it lasted a long time as well. I'll definitely be purchasing this product again in the future!\", \"For starters, they discontinued the old Studio Fix loose powder a year or so ago and since then I had been using the Medium Plus Mineralize Skinfinish compact. I was VERY excited when the MAC Counter rep told me the loose powder was coming back because I wasted so much of the compact applying it with a brush. Boy was I wrong. The 'new' and definitely not improved, Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur is a blur because that's about all you see when you apply it. Zero coverage and chalk like texture. I will be paying the Bobbi Brown counter a visit in the next few days. Also disappointed that MAC stopped the Back to Mac program (returning 6 empty containers for a free lipstick or gloss). To this day it's hard for me to toss my empties and I go through quite a bit of MAC on a regular basis. It was a great way for the company to support the environment and reward their loyal customers for their business. Let's be honest, who ever returned their empty makeup containers without making a single purchase? Not I.\", 'Execelent product I Recomande it', 'This powder can be used to set makeup and you can also wear it alone by itself. I was surprised by how buildable the coverage was for a powder.

I love how flawless the finish is and how it has my pores blurred. This is a definite go to for setting your highlighted areas or all over. Love it.\", 'This is a fantastic brush. Can get into all creases and folds.', \"Now my absolute favorite liquid foundation brush is #170 brush and wrote a separate review about that one. This brush is a great brush too and rotate between this brush, #187, and # 170 brush. I like this brush because it gets around my nose and hard to reach places with precision and ease. It's very soft and gives that amazing airbrushed effect that I love too. I think and this is just me that you should have at least 3 well made foundation brushes especially if you are an avid makeup wearer like me. My makeup represents me when it's on my face. So I highly recommend #170. (my favorite ❤️), #171.  ( second runner up) and #187 stippling foundation brush. These are all amazing brushes and highly recommended them all!!!\", \"This was my first mac brush purchase! I like it! It's a little hard to use, maybe because I'm a novice at crème contouring but it blends pretty good! The quality and softness of the bristles is amazing !

My makeup was popping to the gods yesterday . I bronzed my face with this and wore my Black Panther Royal Vibrancy highlighter with Hard to Get blush on my cheeks. Had the Unfiltered Nudes Palette on my eyes and Haute Pants Powder Kiss Liquid Lipstick on my lips. I was going for a Regal Red look so didn't want to do too much on my eyes. Anyway, the Matte Rich Rosy is absolutely beautiful. I have Sun Power Minerallize Skinfinish and it can't hold a candle to Matte Rich Rosy. My new favorite Bronzer. Highly Recommend this bronzer especially for chocolate girls like me. It's the bomb. Get your hands on it!!!\", 'Suddenly this pedi f cracked after very little use. I owned it like 2 weeks.

Love it!', 'I purchased two bronzers and both are amazing. They are the perfect color for my complexion.', \"This is hands down the prettiest bronzer I have ever used (and I have a drawer full!). It's soft, not harsh or overly pigmented, really does have a rose undertone and really is radiant (not glittery or frosty). And it lasted all day!\", \"My foundation shade is Nc46/47 and this bronzer gives me a beautiful glow that people keep complimenting me on. Also radiant deep golden was a safe color for me, so it's beginner friendly for my skin tone. I also love taking this bronzer and rubbing it on my body.

The shades I received were Ruby True, Bodacious, and Extra Chili.\\n\\nAll three shades can be worn universally in my opinion and will go with a lot of different skin tones.\\n\\nIt does last for a while. Not 24 hours. If you aren't going to be out that long (a few hours) you won't need to touch it up.\\n\\n If you are out for an entire day you may only need to touch up once or twice depending on how you like your lipstick to appear.\\n\\nI would suggest using the lip Scrubtious from Mac when not using the lipstick, to exfoliate your lips and remove any dry flaky skin. Before applying the Lock Kiss inc lipstick. I would suggest applying the MAC Prep and Prime lip primer, for me that helped a lot.\\n\\nAll in all I love the  lipsticks. The application brush makes it super easy to apply to your lips. You don't have to constantly reapply it. Which is a plus. MAC did an amazing job with this. If you are on the fence. I say just go for it. I am sure you will love it!\", 'It stays on all day and does not dry my lips out.  I am ordering more!', \"While Ruby True is a lovely colour, it does not last 24 hours, or even come close to that.

Lasts about maximum 6 hours for me even with priming my lips.  Please release the shade Meticulous in Canada!!', \"I just want to start by saying because I'm a fan of the MAC line, I had certain expectations for this product when I recieved it. Unfortunately they weren't completely met, but I would recommend the product still despite that because I'm not a huge fan of lipsticks for the most part. \\n\\nI loved that the packaging was so petite because it makes it easy to just throw in your back pocket or a purse depending on what you've got going on. I also liked that the color selection was pretty good. However when I tried the product itself, it most definitely did not last 24 hours and because it's advertised as a 24 hour lip color, I thought it should be mentioned. The lip color itself also felt pretty dry on my lips, or maybe more of a matte feel, I'm not sure which one honestly, but it looked glossy when i swatched it on my hand. I also didn't care for the wand either. It reminded me of one of those dollar store lips wands, but it still did its job. The pricing I couldn't get on board with at all. I believe it's pretty overpriced for the product itself. Overall, I would recommend this product, but I'd recommend it to the ones that actually wear lipstick on a normal basis.\", \"At my age, you can imagine I have used many things to keep colour on my lips and cheeks, which is very important in your 50s. I have never been happy with anything on my lips is it never lasts but I tried this and I can't even believe that after 12 hours 13 hours 14 hours I still come home and I have to wash it off my lips.

My skin is normal to dry and I love using this as a primer for my foundation. It creates a really nice smooth base for makeup.', 'This lotion has literally changed my skin in more ways than one. As a 22-year-old, my skin breaks out like crazy. I was using other brand products, having a full skin care routine, using serums and toners, and everything else you can find in the skincare section. I bought this lotion hoping for something good. I can happily say this lotion is my skincare routine. It has transformed my skin to the extreme. I get so many compliments about how glowy I look and how soft my skin looks. It hides any imperfections on my face, keeping me more moisturized than ANY other product I have ever used. It is beautiful without makeup but also is amazing with makeup. I worship this lotion and recommend it to every single person I know. It is the most amazing lotion ever and I will never stop using it. Not to mention it smells amazing, feels amazing, and looks amazing. If there is one product I will spend my money on for the rest of my life, it is absolutely this product. GET IT!!!!', \"This  cream must be paired with a hydrating serum for optimal benefits, it's so so good with a serum, gives healthy looking - skin smoothing glow. without a serum it just sit on the skin,\", \"I bought this along with the matching serum. Totally confused as the serum says it's a serum and moisturizer in one so shoukd I have bought the balm also?? I can't find anywhere that gives any indication that you can use together. Anyway, after seeing Mac raving about it, I trusted what they were promoting and went for it! I don't have the money to spend on products and then find out they're a let down- which this was. It did nothing for me. As a few reviews mention, it sucks what moisture you have on your face and actually left me not hydrated at all. It didn't make me glow and even using both together felt way too much in my skin but again, once asorbed, nothing. One girl mentions she uses the balm first then the serum?!? Anyway, another one bites the dust. I will keep searching!\", \"I was in need of a new skin care regimen and was looking through the Ulta app, when I stumbled across the Hyper Real line. The serum was the highest rated product I had seen on the app. I purchased the line and have been extremely impressed. I have used it morning & night for the past week and can see a huge difference in my skin in only a week! Use the brush and stipple the product onto the skin, and then use your hands to press and seal the products into the skin. As you're applying the serum and balm, you have to kind of move fast because it does absorb into the skin really quickly, which is great for your morning routine because you can apply makeup on top of it and it won't slip and slide everywhere. I have combination skin that starts off my dry and gets oily throughout the day. I can tell the products are giving my skin the hydration it needs during the day because my oil production has slowed and instead just have a nice, healthy glow to my skin throughout the day. My skin is plumper and my skin tone looks more even and radiant. MAC's skin care can take back seat to their makeup, but don't sleep on this skincare line!\", 'I purchased the smaller sample sizes, as i was wary.

It is very lightweight but extremely effective.

I like it for an everyday lipstick. Super moisturizing. Doesn't give me the cracky lipstick look. It does last quite a while, but not the whole day. It does wear off but it's still one of my favs.\", 'A moisture-infused lipstick that provides 12 hours of on-trend, mega-bold color, and ultra-weightless wear in a single, velvet-soft swipe. It is not. My hubby said why is it not staying on? I am sitting at church. But, for the cost, I expect better from this product. I was told to put it on my bottom and top lip.

Its Long wearing, hydrating and most of all its non feathering which is the best. \\n\\nThanks Mac', 'Love the colour and the skinny bottle.', \"I had high hopes for this lipstick and I wasn't disappointed. Firstly,  Nutmeg Ganache was exactly the neutral shade was looking for; secondly, the texture is smooth and rich yet lightweight.

I am am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again.\", 'I loved the color but the texture left a lot to be desired. It felt dry and flaky in the lip. I blended with another lip to smooth the texture.  I would not wear alone.', \"I loved how this felt going on, but this lipstick chapped my lips. My lips were dry and chapped after the first day of wearing then they started to peel. I bought 2 lipsticks, Devoted to Chili and Stay Curious. I should have just bought one.

This color is awesome, plenty of pigment and staying power! It did break often 🙃\", \"Was really excited to try these so bought two different shades. They're too stiff and break easily so you end up losing half the product just trying to figure out how much pressure to use. Texture reminded me of a stiff brow liner. Not very pigmented either.

It really does not smear, and lasts ALL DAY!!!', 'I am not sure if I got a bad item, but this white pencil would not make a mark, even on my hand. It was like a wax crayon.

Wish I could get my money back, but I kept trying to use it, so it is all messed up now. Does not work at all!', 'I love the colour… PERPETUAL SHOCK', \"This product does set very well, but the spray pump is absolutely useless. I'd give this a 2.5 stars due to the cheap faulty spray pump. What good is the product  if the container or dispenser used to help set your make up is faulty? After using it a few times, the product gushes out from the rim, it doesn't spritz onto your skin like Mac's other settings sprays. This spray pump releases big streams of uneven product on your face and it messes up not only my face but my vanity area. I've used all of Mac setting sprays and never ever had this problem. Sad part is Mac knows from other reviews there is a persistent issue with the bottle yet they won't do anything but respond to reviews with a generic cookie cutter useless response. How unbecoming for such a well known brand.\", 'Great for dry skin. Really holds makeup for hours. Will repurchase.', \"Love the stay over spray.  However,  every bottle I have purchased the pump has broken and does not dispense spray evenly.  It's saddening and maddening all at the same time.\", \"So I had to rewrite my review because I mentioned how much it was. The point is the spray nozzle doesn't must and even putting it into other bottles, it won't mist. It's like getting hit with a squirt gun. Waste of money.\", 'So good', \"This is a phenomenal setting spray. It has all the benefits of the hydration and smoothing of the original Fix+ coupled with adding longevity and transfer resistance almost on par with some theatrical-grade formulas - but without making makeup feel heavy at all.\\nI'd give it 5 stars if not for the spray nozzle. The atomizer gets clogged very quickly and the pump breaks easily. I just transfer this to an empty Fix+ bottle as soon as I get a new one.\", 'I love the OG MAC Fix+ spray but I never found it worked well for me for setting my makeup due to the spray nozzle, and it was way too nourishing to set my makeup the way I like my makeup to be set.  However, this product is the perfect balance of being moisturizing without being too nourishing and the nozzle is perfect.  My makeup always looks great by the end of the day and this minimizes the amount of transfer that comes off on my mask.  It does not dry out my skin - I love that it is alcohol free as well.  MAC has another hit on their hands!', 'Fix+ Stay Over lasts all day. I wear blush every day and feel like the color disappears before the morning is over. I have blush all day long. This stuff is completely different than the original Fix+', \"I was so excited for this product, and if it wasn't for a problem with the pump after TWO purchases, I would rate it much higher. With my first purchase, the pump didn't mist evenly, sometimes there were large tear sized globs on my face and the pump would get stuck and leak. Eventually it broke and left me with 1/4 product still unused. When it did work, I liked the effect that the spray had. It married the makeup to my skin nicely and created a nice, finished effect. So I decided to give it another try, assuming I must have gotten a faulty bottle. Sad to report that my second bottle had the same, exact problem. The pump gets jammed, and starts leaking. I still have a lot of product left and I suspect this one will be breaking even sooner than the first. Now I'm shopping for an after market misting spray bottle so I can transfer the remaining product to use before I give up on it completely. It's disappointing because I hold MAC to higher quality standards than this.\", 'I was really excited to try this product but I am disappointed. It does not set my makeup, I notice that the make up under my eyes shifts and collects in creases. After a night out, make up looks washed away. I see all the other positive reviews and wonder why it is not working the same way for me! \\n\\n The previously brand that I used (Dermablend) was so much better.', \"I've tried a few setting sprays over the past couple years and none have made me this happy with a purchase. \\n\\nThis setting spray is amazing. It doesn't leave my skin oily,  cakey, or wet looking. My skin is pretty sensitive when it comes to facial products, and this is the only setting  spray I've tried that doesn't burn.  It keeps my makeup looking great for a whole day, and that's with being out doors chasing my toddler around! \\n\\nHuge bonus is that it smells so good! Some other branded sprays smell like wet dog when sprayed. 😑\\n\\nOverall, I'm super happy with my purchase, so I'll definitely buy it again when I run out.\", \"The skin fix is really amazing! When I first saw this at Mac cosmetics I just had to try it!! The spray illuminates the skin and hydrates the makeup application. The Fix+ spray applicator helps to keep the make up on pretty much all day! It's best to top the skin with a powder finish before spraying on the Fix+.\", \"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could but 4 feels like too many. I haven't used many setting sprays before so I don't have a lot to compare this to, but I don't notice a huge difference whether I use this or not. Small differences though. Makeup still rubs off on the inside of my mask, but  overall I would say my makeup lasts a little longer than without and looks a little less cakey by the end of the day. I also like that it feels hydrating and I think that helps with avoiding cakeyness too. I like the spray nozzle a lot better than the prep and prime too-- it comes out much easier and sprays in a more even mist.\", \"I recently Stopped using my urban decay setting Spray because of this MAC spray! It's amazing and the mister is so refreshing. Not to mention, it literally keeps my makeup looking fresh the ENTIRE time it's on my face. It doesn't move!

Adds length to lashes.\", \"Okay, I did not find this mascara to be more volumizing than most other volumizing mascaras in the market, but let me tell you - the length I achieved was INSANE! I don't think any other MAC formulation has given me that kind of length before, especially without the clumps. I love a lot of CoverGirl mascaras for their ability to volumize way more than this one, but almost all of those are clumpy. So i'm pretty happy with the amount of volume I'm getting here without the lumps of mascara that this 5mm fibre wand is able to achieve. Lasted all day long without flaking off onto my under eye area, so that's a plus too!\", 'Really like this mascara, made my lashes noticeably longer and the pigmentation was nice.

Every time I use this I get some many compliments.', \"I enjoyed working with this mascara! The formula keeps my lashes curled and doesn't feel too thick or runny. Because of my hooded lids, the brush isn't ideal for my use, but I was able to work around it. Minimal smudging/transfer to the under eye area.

I wanna buy more lol', \"The primer is light on the face, absorbs quickly and helps to set different makeup products very well. I tried applying the primer on some spots on my skin to see if they help the foundation to set better and cover the spots almost completely and I was pleasantly surprised! The foundation not only set very well, but the luminosity of the primer helped to hide the blemish better and give my skin a fresh and radiant touch. I also tried the primer with different shades of eyeshadow and I liked the fact that it didn't make the matte shadows shine but it did help to enhance the colors. The effect that I loved the most is that of softening the skin, I tried the first one when I was doing makeup for my mother and it helped a lot to hide some small wrinkles on her face formed around her eyes and lips.\", \"This is the BEST primer EVER !

This primer left my face so incredibly soft after I used it and removed my makeup at the end of the day. My face is usually pretty dry naturally so having it be so hydrating was very beneficial. I used powder foundation and it stayed on all day with primer. Even through a bit of sweat and humidity from the Texas heat.

Handy for on-the-go, travel or just whenever. The MAC eyeshadow formula is one I've always enjoyed. Have quite a few singles in pro palettes. This formula really is even better than before. I had ZERO fall out. I mean none. I never mind it but I can't deny that it makes it easier for cleanup or for those who do eyeshadow after their base (y'all wild). This is one of the color schemes from the new launch I gravitated to most. A true nude palette with a mix of cool, gold and neutral undertones. AND it has 'Cozy Grey' and 'Satin Taupe'? Enough said. Two of my favorites. You can do soft natural, smokey sophisticated, or build a structure to use with another palette. The satin formula is even butterier than before somehow and still doesn't have any big glitter - just a hyper glowy sheen. Mattes are smooth and blend/build just right. Tested the palette on myself without a primer when it arrived and did a simple smokey look on one eye and a more dimensional one on the other (didn't bother doing anything to my extremely downturned lashes, just used eyeliner.

In my collection I have other fragrances that are in the same oceanic fragrance family and lasts much longer, so personally I cannot recommend this to friends and family. It's a shame because this fragrance used to last and project very well.\", 'Very subtle scent, not overpowering. Very clean and fresh. Not long lasting at all. This would be good for a beach day.', \"First time trying this perfume honestly before this i didn't know MAC have a fragrance line. It is a subtle fresh fragrance perfect for summer. I rated just 4 starts because the scent didn't last long on my skin.\", 'This fragrance was a sweet and fresh scent. It is not the typical scent profile I gravitate towards but I do love a lighter fragrance for summer and I will definitely be wearing this to the beach! It seems pretty long lasting and I look forward to the smell of the ocean mixing with the perfume after a long beach day.', 'It was a pleasant scent that lasted throughout the day! Great for any occasion.', 'I did not expect this sample to be the best of what I got. I wish I had a big bottle as a sample. This is one of amazing lightweight fragrance which you and your partner can use if he likes such. I purchased one for myself and yes my husband loves it.', \"At first I didnt like it so much… I thought the fragrance was so strong that you couldnt even spot the different notes but as the day went by, I LOVED IT I could smell the fresh summery vibes with sweet undertones and it's perfect.\", 'The scent smells like I just stepped out of a luxurious beach! I feel like it can work for anyone, regardless of gender!', \"I didn't know what to expect from this scent. It starts off very oceany and then gets a slight musky smell as it dries, it smells feminine but also masculine, it's divine. It's almost elemental but also kinda citrusy but it's not overpowering at all. I squirt was all I needed for my wrists and dabbed it from there to my neck.\"]\n"
