0,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,4,Perfect formula,I think this product is really nice. It went on smoothly. Nice applicator. Not too oily but it was a bit sticky and heavy.
1,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,5,Exactly As Advertised,This is a product that works splendidly to color correct the lips and provide a plumped up glow. Plumps without a strong burn and has a lasting effect. Beautiful shade as well.
2,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,5,Tingly but nice,It gives a nice tingly feeling and has my lips feeling smooth plump and soft. I see you MAC!
3,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,2,Not worth it,"First off, the smell of the gloss is amazing sort of like cake but not too overbearing. But the downsides are that it is sort of like a stick of glue in that it's a bit sticky. So the feeling of it, especially on your mouth, can be uncomfortable. Additionally, it does a have a slight sheen/gloss but it's barely there which some may like. I did not mind. However, it has a purple tint which may look unappealing on a place like your mouth. People may see purple lips and think your sick or something. Lastly, it kind of melts when you put it onto your skin unlike lipstick, which kind of causes you to put on *too much product at once."
4,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,1,I expected more from Mac,"I got the red looking tube. I was really excited to try this product as I am a big Mac fan, but it was left to be disappointing. The tube comes in a bright packaging, so I was expecting the colors to also be as vibrant but once I applied it, it was dull and left more to be desired. Overall, the plumbing effect only happened once I thought a slight tingle, and there wasn't much plumping. The look up the glass stick was not the best, and I didn't flatter me or my complexion at all."
5,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,5,Great lip products,I love how compact this lip product is. It's so easy to use and glided on like butter. And give a great plump without being to uncomfortable
6,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,5,Amazing Product that I am running out to buy!,"I Love this product that I got to test as a free sample from MAC. I is so smooth to the touch with application. I was a bit nervous at first because I thought the purple color would not look right on me. However, it was very translucent in color and the smooth feeling is like one I have never had before. It was also very light on my lips and I forgot about having it on after a while. I also like the little tingle I felt when I put it on."
7,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,1,Eh,I'm a little upset with this one. It's not what I was expecting. It says non sticky and it was very sticky. Also any amount of pressure breaks the gloss. Mine is done for and I just got it yesterday :( not worth the cost.
8,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,5,Everything but plump,Great product it literally does everything but plump!
9,Squirt Plumping Gloss Stick,4,Juicy lips!,The plumping effect paired with the shiny and glossy finish gives the lips the juiciest look! I'm obsessed with how plump they look while not being over the top or uncomfortable. The tingling sensation is quite manageable imo. The only con is that the formula gets quite soft with the warmth of the lips so be careful not to twist up to much product or it can get messy.
10,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,4,Great Packaging and Varying Color Palette,The case is beautiful and has a big mirror which is good. The colors are nice however they don't seem to match therefore may not look good together on the eyelid. There is good pigmentation to it but in order for it to actually pop on my skin tone it needs to be applied multiple times.
11,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,4,Good colors and pigment,"The colors were good on the palette but, since I am black I need to pack on the shadow because it won't show up then. A little chalky like but layering helps."
12,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,3,Beautiful colors sad pigmentation,"The colors are bombing great!
So pretty!
But the pigmentation thought doesn't make the colors be that great on your eyes… if you what better results with the coloring you have to wet your brush before applying it!
But when you do this sometimes you eyes get caked!
So it's a no for me!"
13,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,5,Happy camper,I love the strong beautiful bold colors to match my personality and I rather stand out then to blend in a crowd
14,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,4,Bold & Fun Eye Looks,"I just want to start off and say thank you to MAC Cosmetics for the free Connect in Colour Eye Shadow Palette in exchange for my honest review.
I must say that the packaging is beautiful. I love how bright these colors are. They are super pigmented and very easy to blend out. They have a velvety feel and are long lasting! I must say that Starry Night is by far my favorite shade. This whole palette is giving Bold Space Cowgirl!"
15,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,5,Very Pigmented,I loved this eyeshadow palette. The colors was very vibrant. If you are looking for pigmented colors Mac eyeshadows never fail. I love how the they blend seamlessly together. Highly recommend!!
16,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,5,High definition color!,"I've used this palette twice now, once on my own and one with a professional MUA. I really think these colors show really well on my complexion (medium brown skin tone) I definitely recommend using a concealer to really make the colors pop more but even alone they have a nice tone. I think this specific palette has a nice range of colors overall I would recommend."
17,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,5,Love it !!,"This mac eyeshadow palette is beautiful. The color are gorgeous, the packaging is really high quality. the mirror is so clear and big. The eyeshadow is pigmented, colorful and has a variety of mattes, shimmers and Metallics. I am excited to use this one for the spring and summer time. The packaging was also so nice and felt heavy and good quality.
I love this MAC palette shades!"
18,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,5,Highly Recommend,"I was gifted the Connect in Colour in exchange for my honest review. This palette has a fun color story with bright colors to create a fun look but also some warm tones that can be used for everyday. Very versatile and the consistent MAC quality we know and love. Highly blendable, did not crease and the color payoff is beautiful! If you're thinking about it, just do it! It's a unique palette that will add to your collection!"
19,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Hi-Fi Colour,5,Brightness,This palette has beautiful colors to work with. Easy to blend and perfect for a summer day look and even for a night look. I really enjoy a palette that has a black and my favorite color green in it. I was given this to review but opinions are 100% honest and my own.
20,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,4,Great improvement,I really loved this pallet. The colors were easy to work with and blended really well for me. The pigment was what I like for most of them. It lasted without setting spray for me so that was a win. All in all I really enjoyed using this pallet and I look forward to trying the others!!
21,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,Unfiltered nudes,This new formula was easy to use and didn't take much to build up. I made a quick and beautiful eye look using approximately three shades. This is a nude palette I didn't know I needed.
22,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,Love this shadow palette,"I love this palette! First, I am a huge fan of neutrals and pink shades, so this palette is exactly what I would choose. I took this with me on a recent vacation and it was the only one I needed. So many different combos that I was still able to get a different look everyday even within the same color group. The shadows are super blendable and I was able to use my fingers for quick application on some days and bruises when I had more time to apply. Both looked great. Wore all day no creasing and looked amazing at the end of long day even in heat and humidity. Even lasted through beach day!"
23,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,So sweet!,"Love this color combo. The pink is so soft and sweet for spring and summer. Can easily build the color saturation and make it more sultry. Great for travel if you want something small but can build multiple looks with one palette. I've always loved MAC shadows. The pigment is buttery, saturated, blends smoothly, and feels almost like a soft press. I think the pigment is more finely milled than previous formulas."
24,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,Great Eyeshadow,"This palette is gorgeous, the shades go on so smooth and last all day. Everything in one palette for a complete look. Love the colors!! looking at purchasing the other color sets."
25,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,Get it.,"If you enjoy Mac eyeshadows, these palettes do not disappoint. They are easy to travel with and have everything you need to complete an eye look. I will be buying more."
26,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,Connect in Color-Unflitered Nudes,The colors are BEA U TFUL!  I am finding myself grabbing it over everything else right now.  The colors glide on and blend well!  I purchased in the Embedded in Burgundy too!!  Good amount of product in the palettes -- worth the money. You won't be disappointed!
27,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,Love this palette!,They are 100% right that this color goes on in one swipe. I love that you can wet it to give it a totally different look. It goes on and STAYS on. I've been using it non-stop since I got it. Will definitely be buying in the future.
28,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,Great colours,"Colours go on smooth, blend really well, and lasted all day in the heat and humidity.  Would definitely recommend!"
29,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Rose Lens,5,The perfect smokey eye,"This pallette is simply perfect in every way! I love the color selection.  I can go from natural to sleek all in the same day by adding the smokey colors.  When I go on a trip, this pallette is all I need to take with me! I love how compact the size is!"
30,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,5,Love,Easy to blend. Goes with every look from spring to summer.
31,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,5,I love love it,I blend well on my skin love the long lasting effect.
32,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,5,Bronze Influencer Eyeshadow Palette,This is a very pretty palette on me. For reference I am NC50 in Studio Fix Fluid and NW45 in Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation so I am a chocolate girl with honey blonde hair. I used Soft Ochre Paint Pot all over my eyes and Born to Beam Paint Pit to make that pretty gold shade Data Mode pop and also used Its Fabstract Paint Pot on my outer V to really deepen up Overnight Influencer which is that pretty deep blue green like shade. I used all of the shades except the Olive one which I will be using in a later makeup session. I even filled my brows in with Its Fabstract too and they look really nice too because you can build the intensity to fit your preference . I wore this with gold deposit and cherish lipstick with boldly bare lip pencil and chestnut lip pencils. So so pretty and I highly recommend this palette. You can do so many looks with this one and the colors blended well an easy to work with!!!!
33,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,3,"Okay, for in a Pinch","Love the colors for an everyday look, unfortunately some of the colors mainly the ones with a little sparkle were very patchy. I'm not sure if maybe it was just the pallet I received,  it some of the colors were definitely a fail while others were a hit."
34,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,5,Beautiful colors,Love the earthy glowy tones. can create mulitple looks
35,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,5,Great travel palette,"This palette was great to use on trips,or when you're on the go, it's so compacted fits perfect in a small bag orluggage. The shades are a great combination of mattes and glitters, great for a day to night look. Loved how long lasting and buildable the shades are."
36,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,4,Good,Good eyeshadow. Nice pigmentation.
37,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,5,Quality art with quality product payoff,If MAC is known for anything it's their inclusivity for decades. Being richly melanated it is an amazing feeling knowing that MAC will always have deep bold pigmented products with long lasting payoff. The quality of this palate is like a work of art unique and beautiful. The case is not only gorgeous but the shadows are excellent. It's great having art that I can use to make art.
38,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,4,Pigment!,Such a great eyeshadow palette! The mattes are smooth and are easy to blend and buildable. The shimmers offer high pigment with one swipe. It's easy to get a full glam look with these shadows. Not super beginner friendly since they're so pigmented.
39,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Bronze Influence,4,Reliable Palette,"This is an awesome palette for someone who does a really simple eye look everyday. It has everything you need for day to day makeup. The size of the palette is lovely for travel or even to have on the go. It's a nice sturdy palette that's also pretty. All in all, if you just want a go to palette then this is great."
40,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,5,The perfect eye shadow,I absolutely loved the color scheme for this palette! The shadows were easy to apply and felt buttery soft! It was also very light and didn't flak off. The colors lasted all day and I didn't need to reapply!
41,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,4,Beautiful formula,"This palette is quite impressive, and has such a beautiful soft creamy like formula, pigmentation is amazing. I give this a 9/10 simply because I wish this one was a bigger one and had a slight but more variety but overall it's very cohesive and beautiful for any looks."
42,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,5,Mac Encrypted Kryptonite Palette!,"I really love this eyeshadow! I normally do not wear makeup, but seeing the colors definitely made me excited to see what I could do! I was surprised at how a beginner like myself could still have a really great look! The palette is easy to use, very pigmented colors, and not a hassle if you need to take it when traveling!"
43,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,3,Perfect for beginners,"It's a good palette, just not very good colors. I think some of the color choices felt out of place. Also, the really blush pink was so packed in the pan. It wouldn't transfer on my brush."
44,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,5,Easy Smoky Eye,This Connect in Colour eyeshadow palette makes a smoky eye so easy! The shades aren't super dark but the perfect mix of purples and blacks to make a soft smoky eye. I don't use MAC often so getting this palette was such a treat!
45,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,5,MAC,"This has a good time rate for wearing it without it fading super quickly, it's smooth and pigmented on all thr colors it's also build able so definitely play around with it I definitely recommend"
46,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,3,Lovely colors,"Very beautiful palette for a Smokey eye, unfortunately some colors did not give off great pigmentation but with a little layering worked well."
47,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,4,Encrypted Kryptonite compact palette,"This pallet is the cutest. I really love the packaging it comes in. The artwork on the box and actual pallet compact is very fembot, spacey, showgirl dressing room. The eyeshadows are very pigmented and soft. They last a long time even when you just do a dab. The colors aren't all something I'd use every day but I do find myself reaching for satin taupe and clear history a lot. I like that you can find single pots of individual colors on their website to replace your more used shadows. Smokey eye, grab this compact."
48,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,5,Connect in Colour,RUN! Go grab this pallet quick. It's amazing and highly pigmented with lots of color. I will continue to use it and add more
49,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Encrypted Kryptonite,4,Product review,really enjoyed the palette and colors. I felt the formula on some colors was more rich than others. You can wear it every day as a natural look or night time
50,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,2,Great product - where's the rest of it?,I'm insulted  12 ml for this price???
51,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,4,Never Tried MAC Concealer,"Never tried MAC complexion products before, i Love how convenient and hypoallergenic this pen is. NC50 is perfect to conceal and highlight. Doesn't crease, you can build up the coverage, easy to dispense. The color blended perfectly for me. Received in exchange for review."
52,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,4,Good! One flaw,I got matched at my local MAC and the color is perfect! It covers my blemishes and minor under eye darkness very well. Only downside is it didn't really seem waterproof like it claims. I brought it to my beach vacation as a nice on the go space saver and it definitely started to come off and transfer after one dip in the pool. Still enjoying it though!
53,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,4,Exceeded All Expectations!,"From it's designed twist and lock making it easy and safe to carry in your bag without the need to worry about it leaking, and making a mess, to it being easy and quick to apply on the go. This foundation concealer duo is actually everything it advertises to be. It gives you amazing coverage without the need to use so much product. Blends well, without creasing, giving you a flawless matte finish. The only thing that would of made it better would of been if it had an attached brush head or dabbing sponge but overall it's a new favorite that I plan to purchase when this one runs out.

Sidenote: I received this complimentary sample in exchange for an honest review."
54,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,1,Steer Clear,"This is NOT a good match color-wise. I like the dispenser and the idea, but I need a perfect match to my skin tone."
55,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,5,So good,"I love this pen so so much! It's so convenient, I love how natural it looks and that the packaging is perfect to keep the product safe from bacteria! I like to use it on the days that I don't feel like wearing a ton of makeup!"
56,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,5,Average Makeup,I wouldn't call it a bad product but it's not very great either.
57,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,4,I love this product,Very nice coverage and lomg lasting
58,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,5,Must Have!,I've always been a MAC girl! MAC was the first foundation I tried in college. I modeled so we needed to have a clean base full coverage foundation so MAC was it! As for this product I received it to review and wanted to test it out a few different ways. It works well with my moisturizer and spf! It works well alone too! A must have to use everyday… I love the finish
59,Studio Fix Every-Wear All-Over Face Pen,5,Best concealer for this 30 something tired mom,"Probably one of the best concealers I've tried in the past 10 years. Doesn't crease, you can build up the coverage, easy to dispense. The color blended perfectly for me, without the raccoon eye.
I have tried several concealers and is a must have for me. If I had to pick only one make up item, when I don't have time, it's just this!"
60,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,5,awesome,The shade was a good match for me. It is perfect for setting makeup. Blurs pores well.
61,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,5,Great!,"The Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur  setting powder is a nice powder for everyday use. The formula is soft and feels buttery as you blend. Over a full look, it sets with a very matte finish. Its pigment isn't very opaque on its own but it still does blur away some imperfections. I particularly like that this product comes with an applicator poof, which makes it convenient to throw in your bag for on the go touch ups. One thing about the design I thought was a little funky was the mesh cover over the loose powder, It helps with waste but doesn't easily allow for brush application. Overall this powder lives up to the MAC quality you can expect from them, I would recommend to anyone wanting to try something new."
62,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,4,Workable,This powder was able to be used all day. But the color was wrong for me.I gave to friend who loved this MAC studio.fix
63,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,3,"Barely there feel, silky smooth","I received a free sample for my honest review. Truly lightweight, barely there feel. I really love the texture and that it wore well while out running errands on a hot day. Didn't cake or settle, it's almost perfect. The reason for 3 stars is that it's quite dark for being medium. I applied it with just primer to see how well it would match my regular tone and I felt like it gave me a golden sun-kissed look. I personally didn't mind but I know I would've been upset had I applied it over a full face of foundation. It's definitely worth going to a store to see which on we would best fit your tone."
64,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,4,Its prettyyy good🤭,"It was pretty good, i used it for some events at school and i also used it for my dance show i did, stayed on very well!!"
65,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,5,Such a great loose power!,I absolutely love this product. It made my face feel so smooth and almost gave it a blurred effect. I really like how it lasted a long time as well. I'll definitely be purchasing this product again in the future!
66,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,2,Worst Loose Powder - MAC your product quality is lacking,"For starters, they discontinued the old Studio Fix loose powder a year or so ago and since then I had been using the Medium Plus Mineralize Skinfinish compact. I was VERY excited when the MAC Counter rep told me the loose powder was coming back because I wasted so much of the compact applying it with a brush. Boy was I wrong. The 'new' and definitely not improved, Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur is a blur because that's about all you see when you apply it. Zero coverage and chalk like texture. I will be paying the Bobbi Brown counter a visit in the next few days. Also disappointed that MAC stopped the Back to Mac program (returning 6 empty containers for a free lipstick or gloss). To this day it's hard for me to toss my empties and I go through quite a bit of MAC on a regular basis. It was a great way for the company to support the environment and reward their loyal customers for their business. Let's be honest, who ever returned their empty makeup containers without making a single purchase? Not I."
67,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,5,Mac studio Fix,Execelent product I Recomande it
68,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,4,MAC-nigficent!,"This powder can be used to set makeup and you can also wear it alone by itself. I was surprised by how buildable the coverage was for a powder. On a hot day this powder, a little concealer, setting spray and lipgloss will be my go to face."
69,Studio Fix Pro Set + Blur Weightless Loose Powder,4,Flawless finish,I got this powder in dark for a full face set and I must say it sets my makeup perfectly *chef's kiss. I love how flawless the finish is and how it has my pores blurred. This is a definite go to for setting your highlighted areas or all over. Love it.
70,171S SMOOTH-EDGE ALL OVER FACE BRUSH,5,Nice brush,This is a fantastic brush. Can get into all creases and folds.
71,171S SMOOTH-EDGE ALL OVER FACE BRUSH,5,#171  Smooth Edge All Over Face Brush,"Now my absolute favorite liquid foundation brush is #170 brush and wrote a separate review about that one. This brush is a great brush too and rotate between this brush, #187, and # 170 brush. I like this brush because it gets around my nose and hard to reach places with precision and ease. It's very soft and gives that amazing airbrushed effect that I love too. I think and this is just me that you should have at least 3 well made foundation brushes especially if you are an avid makeup wearer like me. My makeup represents me when it's on my face. So I highly recommend #170. (my favorite ❤️), #171.  ( second runner up) and #187 stippling foundation brush. These are all amazing brushes and highly recommended them all!!!"
72,171S SMOOTH-EDGE ALL OVER FACE BRUSH,4,Maybe I'm the problem,"This was my first mac brush purchase! I like it! It's a little hard to use, maybe because I'm a novice at crème contouring but it blends pretty good! The quality and softness of the bristles is amazing ! I think it's worth the investment, I'm gonna keep trying to learn how to use it lol"
73,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK MATTE BRONZER,5,Love it,Just a touch of sun kissed.  Best bronzer I have ever bought- really. And I have tried many. Thank you for this product. Goes on light so not obvious and blends well.
74,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK MATTE BRONZER,5,Matte Sunstruck Bronzer,"I got the Matte Sunstruck Bronzer in Matte Rich Rosy I M NC50 in liquid foundation and NW45 in Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation for reference. My makeup was popping to the gods yesterday . I bronzed my face with this and wore my Black Panther Royal Vibrancy highlighter with Hard to Get blush on my cheeks. Had the Unfiltered Nudes Palette on my eyes and Haute Pants Powder Kiss Liquid Lipstick on my lips. I was going for a Regal Red look so didn't want to do too much on my eyes. Anyway, the Matte Rich Rosy is absolutely beautiful. I have Sun Power Minerallize Skinfinish and it can't hold a candle to Matte Rich Rosy. My new favorite Bronzer. Highly Recommend this bronzer especially for chocolate girls like me. It's the bomb. Get your hands on it!!!"
75,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK MATTE BRONZER,3,Great bronzer horrible packaging/quality,Suddenly this pedi f cracked after very little use. I owned it like 2 weeks. I like the lighter shade ranges for bronzer on fair skin. Very disappointed in the MAC quality cracking.
76,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK MATTE BRONZER,5,Obsessed,"This bronzer has become ny go to ever since I've purchased it. Doesn't leave any streaky or patchy texture, goes on smooth and look so good."
77,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK MATTE BRONZER,5,Thank Goodness!,I had just about given up on Mac Bronzer after using the limited edition MAC Electric Wonder in Canyon Dreamin'.  This bronzer could be a little creamier but the color pay off is pretty good.  Wish one of the colors was close to Canyon Dreamin'.  I did purchase in Matte Medium Golden.
78,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK MATTE BRONZER,5,Bronzer,This specific color is perfect for my complexion. It looks amazing in my light to medium skin tone. Love it!
79,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK MATTE BRONZER,5,Bronzers,I purchased two bronzers and both are amazing. They are the perfect color for my complexion.
80,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK RADIANT BRONZER,5,So Pretty!,"This is hands down the prettiest bronzer I have ever used (and I have a drawer full!). It's soft, not harsh or overly pigmented, really does have a rose undertone and really is radiant (not glittery or frosty). And it lasted all day!"
81,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK RADIANT BRONZER,5,Golden Goddess Material,"My foundation shade is Nc46/47 and this bronzer gives me a beautiful glow that people keep complimenting me on. Also radiant deep golden was a safe color for me, so it's beginner friendly for my skin tone. I also love taking this bronzer and rubbing it on my body. Makes me look like I have model skin."
82,SKINFINISH SUNSTRUCK RADIANT BRONZER,5,Fabulosity,The bronzer of the century. It is smooth as silk. The waterproof protection is perfect for the environment I live in. Purchasing two different colors. I would recommend this product for a San Tropez glow without leaving the comfort of your home.
83,Prep + Prime Fix + / Richard Quinn,5,Mist  me please!!,Smells great not to strong moisturizing and refreshing does a great job at setting ..you can't go wrong with this one!!
84,Prep + Prime Fix + / Richard Quinn,5,Cherry-tastic Fix+,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THE SCENT! Sweet and lightweight, and we all know and love the Fix+ formula. It's been my evening moisturizer since my purchase. The smell goes great with my night time skin care routine!"
85,Quinning Eye Shadow Palette,5,Great palette!,"Definitely one of the colour best palettes I have seen in a long time!  Colours are great,  easy to mix and match with other shades. Easy to apply with your finger or a brush."
86,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,4,Great long-lasting liquid lipstick,"This lipstick is super long lasting and the colour and matte texture looks beautiful - as long as you don't eat anything too oily! Once you do, it'll start to flake off so try to avoid oily foods if you can while wearing it."
87,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,2,Disappointing,"A great pigment but does not stay and certainly not for 24 hours. There is also no coverage, and it is a bit streaky. This one is a miss despite the excellent red. 

I did use the primer which normally would have helped a ton."
88,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,1,Dosent stay,I can't determine if it's me doing something wrong or the lipstick in general but this does not stay on. I literally get about two hours wear out of it. All of my other Mac Matt liquid lipsticks stay on for hours. I definitely think I'll be returning this.
89,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,1,"Too dry , so sad","Too dry , so disappointed of this product, lots of good comments online but dry my lips so bad so disappointed ☹️ and not long lasting at all , after drinking all gone …"
90,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,5,I love it!,"I received this product from MAC for a review under the MAC Lover loyalty program. The shades I received were Ruby True, Bodacious, and Extra Chili.

All three shades can be worn universally in my opinion and will go with a lot of different skin tones.

It does last for a while. Not 24 hours. If you aren't going to be out that long (a few hours) you won't need to touch it up.

 If you are out for an entire day you may only need to touch up once or twice depending on how you like your lipstick to appear.

I would suggest using the lip Scrubtious from Mac when not using the lipstick, to exfoliate your lips and remove any dry flaky skin. Before applying the Lock Kiss inc lipstick. I would suggest applying the MAC Prep and Prime lip primer, for me that helped a lot.

All in all I love the  lipsticks. The application brush makes it super easy to apply to your lips. You don't have to constantly reapply it. Which is a plus. MAC did an amazing job with this. If you are on the fence. I say just go for it. I am sure you will love it!"
91,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,5,REALLY STAYS,It stays on all day and does not dry my lips out.  I am ordering more!
92,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,2,Disappointed,"While Ruby True is a lovely colour, it does not last 24 hours, or even come close to that. I found that even having a drink and eating some crisps resulted in the lipstick wearing off and my lips looking patchy while the cup had traces of red round the rim.

This was my first time using MAC products and I was looking forward to finding a long lasting lipstick in a beautiful red but I was very disappointed with the product. I even purchased MAC's Lip Prep + Prime to help but that made my lips feel horrible and didn't help the lipstick stay on."
93,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,4,Lovely,This liquid lipstick colour is gorgeous.  Lasts about maximum 6 hours for me even with priming my lips.  Please release the shade Meticulous in Canada!!
94,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,3,Hit or Miss,"I just want to start by saying because I'm a fan of the MAC line, I had certain expectations for this product when I recieved it. Unfortunately they weren't completely met, but I would recommend the product still despite that because I'm not a huge fan of lipsticks for the most part. 

I loved that the packaging was so petite because it makes it easy to just throw in your back pocket or a purse depending on what you've got going on. I also liked that the color selection was pretty good. However when I tried the product itself, it most definitely did not last 24 hours and because it's advertised as a 24 hour lip color, I thought it should be mentioned. The lip color itself also felt pretty dry on my lips, or maybe more of a matte feel, I'm not sure which one honestly, but it looked glossy when i swatched it on my hand. I also didn't care for the wand either. It reminded me of one of those dollar store lips wands, but it still did its job. The pricing I couldn't get on board with at all. I believe it's pretty overpriced for the product itself. Overall, I would recommend this product, but I'd recommend it to the ones that actually wear lipstick on a normal basis."
95,M·A·C Locked Kiss Ink 24HR Lipcolour,5,I've seen it all!,"At my age, you can imagine I have used many things to keep colour on my lips and cheeks, which is very important in your 50s. I have never been happy with anything on my lips is it never lasts but I tried this and I can't even believe that after 12 hours 13 hours 14 hours I still come home and I have to wash it off my lips. It is not uncomfortable, I can eat drink blow my nose whatever it is , until I take it off and it's the best product I have ever ever seen and all of my years!"
96,Matte Lipstick / Mother’s Day,5,Favourite Lip Colour!,I love this gorgeous colour! The Mother's Day exclusive packaging is so cute! Highly recommend it!
97,Matte Lipstick / Mother’s Day,5,Beautiful color,Does not last very long but cute color.
98,Matte Lipstick / Mother’s Day,5,Favorite For Many Years,I've worn Chili for many years but I enjoyed purchasing it in several new packaging. So fun and pretty!
99,Matte Lipstick / Mother’s Day,5,So cute!,"Love the color chili. It's a warm brick red as stated, not too warm and not bright. Goes on nicely and stays on a while unless you eat 😂 and the packaging was the icing on the cake!"
100,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,2,Don't buy,So disappointed with this. It flakes massively and looks like I have black dots all over my face. I mean what the #%£@ MAC
101,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,4,I love it,Great and would love keep
102,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,3,Clumps easily,I tried the non waterproof one in a shop near me (not MAC) as they didn't have a waterproof tester. I loved it but went for the waterproof version but found from day one that it does seem to clump fairly easily. I'm not sure if this is down to the waterproof version/formula or whether it's a faulty item. Looking at all the reviews everyone seems to love it?!
103,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,5,Love it!,"It is, as it says, water-proof and long-lasting. It makes my lashes look longer and thicker in just two applications. For a first-timer to wearing mascara, this is perfect!"
104,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,5,Great Mascara!,This has become one of my favorite mascaras! Highly recommend!
105,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,1,Bleed down my face,I usually use the extreme lash waterproof but was recommended to try this one. I wore it for a week and everyday by noon I had black circles under my eyes. I tried primer and that did not help.
106,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,5,Smooth,Smooth when putting on! Lasts all day.
107,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,5,Love!,"My lashes are short and stubby but after falling in love with this new mascara wand I've gotten used to having eyelashes again. I still have hard to curl lashes though so when the waterproof version came out I knew I had to try it as I get a better curl with waterproof mascaras. This is perfect, helps keep my lashes curled, doesn't flake and also washes off fairly easy for a waterproof mascara. This and the 3d mascara are my favorites!"
108,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,5,FANTASTIC!!!,"For years I have been using a combination of 2 very expensive mascaras to achieve the look of 3 coats of this fantastic mascara. It would take me about 20 minutes to get the look I wanted. Decided to try this after I read the reviews. I'm so impressed with how it covers the lashes, thickens and lengthens. I purchased 2 more as back ups!!! I don't know how women put on false eyelashes. I have oved heavy mascara for decades. I'm almost 70 and wear mascar every day."
109,M·A·CStack Waterproof Mascara,5,excellent,Great mascara! Love the tube and it lasts all day long! great volume for a full look. It might last a little too well lol
110,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Innovative Product,"The Mac LASH DRY SHAMPOO MASCARA REFRESHER is a unique and innovative product that can be a great addition to your makeup routine. If you are looking for a way to refresh your mascara without having to remove it and reapply it, then this product is worth trying.

This can save you time and money, especially if you are someone who wears mascara regularly. The product is also clump-resistant, which means you can achieve a more natural look without worrying about clumps."
111,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Finally Fierce,"The first beauty product I ever used was mascara, I've always had long but stick straight lashes that I'd struggle with. Mainly I couldn't find a product that gave me volume & length without looking like ""spider leg lashes"" by the end of the day. The right spoolie brush on the wand was also tough to find. This product had solved so many of my lash issues! Most days I'd have to recurl & reapply my mascara by mid day & they'd just stick together. This formula by MAC feels like a conditioner that works with the product I'm already wearing to give me a boost that ends up looking & feeling like I've just applied it. No more dry mascara layers that flake off everywhere! Another feature I love is that the Lash Shampoo is black & is perfect for days when you don't want to wear or look like you're wearing make-up. I've noticed I no longer need to recurl my eyelashes anymore either. I love the wand too. Definitely a cool product you wouldn't think you'd need until you try it, then find you don't want to be without!"
112,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,3,Everlasting,I tried the product and was surprise as to how long it last. I did not expect for it to feel as thick as it did and heavy at first. I would recommend it for those long outings.
113,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Great touch up,This product is great for touching up mascara! It separates lashes and darkens them up without clumping! Genius product
114,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,very impressed,This is my new go to when it comes to long wear. On those long days that turn into evening I wipe this over my mascara and notice such a huge difference. Instant plumpness and color!
115,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Mac Lash Shampoo,Loved how it made my eyelashes looked healthy and long.
116,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Love it,Perfect product to make my mascara last longer. Looked refreshed and perfect
117,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Very interesting product!,"I was actually pretty confused and skeptical about how would this product work but I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn't make your mascara feel heavier, but it revives it and avoids crustiness while giving you thickness and length."
118,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Great Product,The MAC Dry Lash Shampoo Mascara Refresher is a great product to have! It's easy to use and I love how it extended my lashes! Definitely recommend!
119,Lash Dry Shampoo Mascara Refresher,5,Best Refresh,I love the lash dry shampoo mascara refresher! Mascara products are hard to come by as a lot of them are made to just be used on its own but using this product on top of any of my mascaras has been life changing! I love that it adds more volume and lift and its easy to do especially for the days where I need my lashes to last from morning to night. It doesn't add clump which is a big plus in my book as a lot of mascaras are clump prone.
120,Matte Lipstick / Chili's Crew,4,Chilli Lipstick,Beautiful shade that is a blend of orange and brick red colors. Lipstick is pigmented and hydrating and applies smoothly on the lips.
121,Retro Matte Liquid Lipcolour / Chili's Crew,4,loved it,Great product
122,Lustreglass Lipstick / Chili's Crew,5,Buy thissssss,Cute color. A bit dry.
123,M·A·CStack Micro Mascara / Mini M·A·C,5,Passed my wear test 👍,"This mascara really passed my wear test, after 10 hours of wear it still looks the same way the moment I put it on, lash up  keeps the curl, no flakes, it does not clump too,  this is what makes this mascara special and will buy it again for that"
124,Eye Shadow x 8 / New Year Shine,4,great for days and nights,"like the shades, so versatile"
125,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Must have for Skin!,"I absolutely love this serum and moisturizer in one! It works on ALL skin types and has so many benefits in the formula. It works on sensitive skin and smells amazing! I've used this for almost a year now and it has helped a lot with the texture of my skin and breakouts. I wear this under my Studio Fix Fluid and it holds beautifully throughout the day, my makeup doesn't run off or start to settle and it helps keep my makeup looking fresh"
126,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Get It!,"Initially got the sample & noticed a difference after1 use. I know…that's not the ""norm"" but it's totally worth it!!! Get it!!"
127,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Best Serum I used!,I got this as a sample while looking for a new foundation and my skin was so dry and piling and the artist at the store gave me a sample and it is the best thing I ever used on my skin! I also use the balm on top and my skin is normally so oily but this keeps it more matte.
128,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Lightweight,This product is very lightweight and so absorbent that I barely feel it. I have a textured and pimple prone skin but I have never had a breakout since using MAC Hyper Real Serumizer. It makes my skin look healthy and bright to the degree that I have received a couple of compliments.
129,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Amazing product,"I have incredibly oily skin and have tried everything on it, the serumizer has changed the game for me! Being a serum and moisturiser I don't have to pack on loads of products and make my skin feel heavy! I've been using this for just over a month and already have my back up in my skincare drawer ready to go! My skin feels so soft after every use and throughout the day my face isn't getting anywhere near as oily! I cannot recommend this product enough!"
130,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Sensitive skin? BUY IT,"I have super sensitive skin and just about everything irritates or causes breakouts. But this glides on, hydrates and smooths. Does exactly what it promises… and NO breakouts!"
131,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,1,My face burns,"I don't have sensitive skin, but this serum made my entire face itchy! And it burns a little bit. Good thing I bought a small bottle to test it first! My face currently looks like a tomato. I usually use rubbing alcohol on my face with no problem, but this serum did not work for me. Smells good and feel smooth after applying but it's a no for me."
132,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Awesome!,"WOW! This serum moisturizer is everything! For years now, I have been looking for the perfect face moisturizer and here it is! I actually tried this serum with the free sample for a week and just within 3 days, my facial skin became so hydrated, moisturized, supple, clear and smooth with my visible pores gradually disappearing. I still can't believe my eyes that MAC finally invented this awesome serum. Yes I have very sensitive skin prone to acne and sorts and won't even dare try any product for even 3 days as my face will almost be covered in... But to my greatest surprise I am glowing already and my makeup is so perfected wearing them with this wonderful serum. This is magic at its best! Thanks MAC!"
133,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,Does what it claims,"Smooths the surface and hydrates, my favorite foundation primer to date. I applied with the recommended brush and my foundation went on so smoothly. I'm older but only have some very fine lines and dryness, this solved those issues. I didn't have a reaction to it--and serums often will break me out."
134,Hyper Real Serumizer™ Skin Balancing Hydration Serum,5,amazing texture,"I bought this a couple weeks ago and so far it is pretty amazing. The texture is beautiful, much thicker than a usual serum but not goopy or greasy at all. It feels lovely on the skin and I do see an improvement with the look of my skin after application, especially in the eye wrinkle area. I think you actually can use this in place of moisturizer, which I was sceptical about since I have very dry skin. Doesn't seem to affect my rosacea either, which is great."
135,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,5,Got this as sample!,"I was in search on a new skincare regimen, my skin was dry and piling and just dehydrated and I have very oily skin. I got this and the serum as sample when I went to get colour matched for Studio Fix Fluid and it is the best thing I have have used on my skin! I don't feel greasy through the day and my skin is soft and smooth."
136,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,5,BEST SKINCARE EVER,This is literally the only thing I've found to clear my skin and balance my skin out!!! This is gold to me!
137,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,5,Great new product,This is a great new product addition to the line. A little bit goes a long way. So it will definitely last you.
138,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,5,Amazing for Normal to Dry Skin,I love this moisturizer. My skin is normal to dry and I love using this as a primer for my foundation. It creates a really nice smooth base for makeup.
139,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,5,AMAZING!!! MUST BUY!!!,"This lotion has literally changed my skin in more ways than one. As a 22-year-old, my skin breaks out like crazy. I was using other brand products, having a full skin care routine, using serums and toners, and everything else you can find in the skincare section. I bought this lotion hoping for something good. I can happily say this lotion is my skincare routine. It has transformed my skin to the extreme. I get so many compliments about how glowy I look and how soft my skin looks. It hides any imperfections on my face, keeping me more moisturized than ANY other product I have ever used. It is beautiful without makeup but also is amazing with makeup. I worship this lotion and recommend it to every single person I know. It is the most amazing lotion ever and I will never stop using it. Not to mention it smells amazing, feels amazing, and looks amazing. If there is one product I will spend my money on for the rest of my life, it is absolutely this product. GET IT!!!!"
140,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,4,SKIN CANVAS  BALM,"This  cream must be paired with a hydrating serum for optimal benefits, it's so so good with a serum, gives healthy looking - skin smoothing glow. without a serum it just sit on the skin,"
141,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,1,Nothing Special,"I bought this along with the matching serum. Totally confused as the serum says it's a serum and moisturizer in one so shoukd I have bought the balm also?? I can't find anywhere that gives any indication that you can use together. Anyway, after seeing Mac raving about it, I trusted what they were promoting and went for it! I don't have the money to spend on products and then find out they're a let down- which this was. It did nothing for me. As a few reviews mention, it sucks what moisture you have on your face and actually left me not hydrated at all. It didn't make me glow and even using both together felt way too much in my skin but again, once asorbed, nothing. One girl mentions she uses the balm first then the serum?!? Anyway, another one bites the dust. I will keep searching!"
142,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,5,Hyper Real is the Real Deal!,"I was in need of a new skin care regimen and was looking through the Ulta app, when I stumbled across the Hyper Real line. The serum was the highest rated product I had seen on the app. I purchased the line and have been extremely impressed. I have used it morning & night for the past week and can see a huge difference in my skin in only a week! Use the brush and stipple the product onto the skin, and then use your hands to press and seal the products into the skin. As you're applying the serum and balm, you have to kind of move fast because it does absorb into the skin really quickly, which is great for your morning routine because you can apply makeup on top of it and it won't slip and slide everywhere. I have combination skin that starts off my dry and gets oily throughout the day. I can tell the products are giving my skin the hydration it needs during the day because my oil production has slowed and instead just have a nice, healthy glow to my skin throughout the day. My skin is plumper and my skin tone looks more even and radiant. MAC's skin care can take back seat to their makeup, but don't sleep on this skincare line!"
143,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,3,Not for Dehydrated or dry skin,"I purchased the smaller sample sizes, as i was wary. I was right to be, i used both the balm and the serum and they sucked all the water out my foundation leaving me with a cracked and patchy base from lunchtime all afternoon. My regular skin care works like a dream and i gave my purchase to a colleague at work."
144,Hyper Real SkinCanvas Balm™ Moisturizing Cream,5,Great moisturizer!,I love everything about this product line! This moisturizer has worked wonders for my skin. I am absolutely in love with it and I will never switch to anything else!
145,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,5,Works great,Lightweight great formula. I use it as a moisturizer sometimes.
146,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,2,High Hopes,I was excited to try this because I love oil cleansing in place of makeup remover wipes. I used this a few times and each time it unfortunately left my skin dry  and flaky - but it definitely removed my makeup. The packaging is nice though
147,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,2,Blurred Vision and Irritated Eyes,I bought this product to help with removing stubborn eye makeup. The oil spurts out of the dispenser awkwardly so much of it is wasted. It removes the unwanted makeup but   I have blurred vision and all day eye irritation after use. I don't know what ingredient is causing it.
148,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,5,A must!,This is the best cleanser I have ever used! It is very lightweight but extremely effective. My skin has a glow to it now that I haven't seen since I was in my teens!
149,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,4,Very cleansing,I really like this product because it begins as an oil to break down any make up then turns into a wash once you add water! Very moisturizing and doesn't strip your face?
150,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,4,Good,This is a good cleansing oil that removes make up well. It does not break me out which is a plus!
151,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,5,I would buy this again and again,"I am in love with this cleansing oil! My skin feels amazing after using, no exaggeration. My skin feels super soft and refreshed. A little bit goes a long way and it didn't irritate my skin. Plus, it isn't greasy or drying."
152,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,5,Great for makeup removal!,The oil was very cleansing and melted my leftover make up right off. It does need to be followed with a cleanser otherwise it feels like there's still residue.
153,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,1,Blurry vision after use,After I used this makeup removal my vision was blurry for More than one minute
154,Hyper Real Fresh Canvas Cleansing Oil,4,"Trusted Brand, Worth the Hype","The brand that keeps on giving! I'm so happy this is now a part of my skin care routine. Lightweight, good texture, pleasant smell and overall great investment."
155,001 Serum + Moisturizer Brush,5,Best skincare brush ever!,This brush is by far unlike any other. The bristles are the softest and it blends the serumizer into your skin so well. It's a definite must have!
156,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,4,Good shade,"I always wanted to try on this slim stick and when the colors in red shades went on sale, I decided to get one. ""Devoted in Danger"" is slightly on orange side, easy glide on, moisturizing and stays for 3-6 hours with minimal touch up. I am curious to check out nude and pink shades in this series."
157,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,5,Velvety for sure,Great feel and color along with some staying power to get me thru my day.
158,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,5,Perfect everyday color,"I spent so much time finding a perfect everyday color, I would recommend Asian skin tone to try this, it make my face look more even."
159,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,5,LOVE,"I've been repurchasing ever since I tried it. I like it for an everyday lipstick. Super moisturizing. Doesn't give me the cracky lipstick look. It does last quite a while, but not the whole day. It does wear off but it's still one of my favs."
160,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,1,Not living up to the 12 hrs.,"A moisture-infused lipstick that provides 12 hours of on-trend, mega-bold color, and ultra-weightless wear in a single, velvet-soft swipe. It is not. My hubby said why is it not staying on? I am sitting at church. But, for the cost, I expect better from this product. I was told to put it on my bottom and top lip. It still came off. 
The only thing that I like about this lipstick is the color."
161,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,5,Powder kiss velvet blur,"One of my favorite that Mac got me obsess with. Its Long wearing, hydrating and most of all its non feathering which is the best. 

Thanks Mac"
162,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,5,Love the colour,Love the colour and the skinny bottle.
163,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,5,A winner!,"I had high hopes for this lipstick and I wasn't disappointed. Firstly,  Nutmeg Ganache was exactly the neutral shade was looking for; secondly, the texture is smooth and rich yet lightweight. Thirdly, the most important thing to me is durability: this one lasts and fades evenly. I am am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again."
164,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,2,Powder Kiss not Chef's kiss.,I loved the color but the texture left a lot to be desired. It felt dry and flaky in the lip. I blended with another lip to smooth the texture.  I would not wear alone.
165,Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick,1,Extremely drying,"I loved how this felt going on, but this lipstick chapped my lips. My lips were dry and chapped after the first day of wearing then they started to peel. I bought 2 lipsticks, Devoted to Chili and Stay Curious. I should have just bought one. I used balm and lip scrub before application same. This lipstick also transfers badly. The only Mac lipstick that doesn't dry out my lips is the cremesheen from Mac and Viva la Glam V which is d/c it was my favorite lipstick of all time."
166,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,5,Obsessed,Love them
167,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,5,Gel Eyeliner Longwear,IN LOVE WITH THIS EYELINER. I've tried other blue eye pencils and they would barely show up. This blue stays and slays!!
168,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,5,Super easy to use,Easier to use than your regular liquid eye liner ! Highly recommend! Goes with everything
169,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,1,Not a Gel Liner,"This is NOT even close to being a ""gel"" eyeliner. Feels like a mostly dried out liquid pen. Skips/hesitates/pulls the skin. I have tried other gel liners, and this one is the worst. Won't buy again. First & Only MAC Eyeliner experience"
170,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,5,gel eye liner,goes on smooth
171,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,4,ColorFantastic,"Oh em' Gee gurlz! This color is awesome, plenty of pigment and staying power! It did break often 🙃"
172,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,1,Breaks easily,Was really excited to try these so bought two different shades. They're too stiff and break easily so you end up losing half the product just trying to figure out how much pressure to use. Texture reminded me of a stiff brow liner. Not very pigmented either. Whatever pigment I managed to get out was long-lasting tho. Overall super disappointed.
173,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,5,Great product,"This is the best eyeliner I have ever had. It really does not smear, and lasts ALL DAY!!!"
174,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,1,"Did not work, glide on, made no mark","I am not sure if I got a bad item, but this white pencil would not make a mark, even on my hand. It was like a wax crayon. I bought the balck, which was fine, but I couldnt get the white to work, even when I heated it. Nothing, then kept breaking. Wish I could get my money back, but I kept trying to use it, so it is all messed up now. Does not work at all!"
175,M·A·C Colour Excess Gel Pencil Eye Liner,5,Eye Liner,I love the colour… PERPETUAL SHOCK
176,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,2,Good spray horrible bottle,"This product does set very well, but the spray pump is absolutely useless. I'd give this a 2.5 stars due to the cheap faulty spray pump. What good is the product  if the container or dispenser used to help set your make up is faulty? After using it a few times, the product gushes out from the rim, it doesn't spritz onto your skin like Mac's other settings sprays. This spray pump releases big streams of uneven product on your face and it messes up not only my face but my vanity area. I've used all of Mac setting sprays and never ever had this problem. Sad part is Mac knows from other reviews there is a persistent issue with the bottle yet they won't do anything but respond to reviews with a generic cookie cutter useless response. How unbecoming for such a well known brand."
177,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,5,Great setting spray,Great for dry skin. Really holds makeup for hours. Will repurchase.
178,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,3,"I would highly recommend but,","Love the stay over spray.  However,  every bottle I have purchased the pump has broken and does not dispense spray evenly.  It's saddening and maddening all at the same time."
179,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,1,"Product doesn't mist, it's like a stream","So I had to rewrite my review because I mentioned how much it was. The point is the spray nozzle doesn't must and even putting it into other bottles, it won't mist. It's like getting hit with a squirt gun. Waste of money."
180,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,5,Setting spray,So good
181,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,4,Great Formula - Faulty Nozzle,"This is a phenomenal setting spray. It has all the benefits of the hydration and smoothing of the original Fix+ coupled with adding longevity and transfer resistance almost on par with some theatrical-grade formulas - but without making makeup feel heavy at all.
I'd give it 5 stars if not for the spray nozzle. The atomizer gets clogged very quickly and the pump breaks easily. I just transfer this to an empty Fix+ bottle as soon as I get a new one."
182,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,5,The best yet,"I love the OG MAC Fix+ spray but I never found it worked well for me for setting my makeup due to the spray nozzle, and it was way too nourishing to set my makeup the way I like my makeup to be set.  However, this product is the perfect balance of being moisturizing without being too nourishing and the nozzle is perfect.  My makeup always looks great by the end of the day and this minimizes the amount of transfer that comes off on my mask.  It does not dry out my skin - I love that it is alcohol free as well.  MAC has another hit on their hands!"
183,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,5,All Day,Fix+ Stay Over lasts all day. I wear blush every day and feel like the color disappears before the morning is over. I have blush all day long. This stuff is completely different than the original Fix+
184,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,2,Faulty Pump,"I was so excited for this product, and if it wasn't for a problem with the pump after TWO purchases, I would rate it much higher. With my first purchase, the pump didn't mist evenly, sometimes there were large tear sized globs on my face and the pump would get stuck and leak. Eventually it broke and left me with 1/4 product still unused. When it did work, I liked the effect that the spray had. It married the makeup to my skin nicely and created a nice, finished effect. So I decided to give it another try, assuming I must have gotten a faulty bottle. Sad to report that my second bottle had the same, exact problem. The pump gets jammed, and starts leaking. I still have a lot of product left and I suspect this one will be breaking even sooner than the first. Now I'm shopping for an after market misting spray bottle so I can transfer the remaining product to use before I give up on it completely. It's disappointing because I hold MAC to higher quality standards than this."
185,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray,1,Disappointed,"I was really excited to try this product but I am disappointed. It does not set my makeup, I notice that the make up under my eyes shifts and collects in creases. After a night out, make up looks washed away. I see all the other positive reviews and wonder why it is not working the same way for me! 

 The previously brand that I used (Dermablend) was so much better."
186,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray / Mini M·A·C,5,Amazing setting spray!,"I've tried a few setting sprays over the past couple years and none have made me this happy with a purchase. 

This setting spray is amazing. It doesn't leave my skin oily,  cakey, or wet looking. My skin is pretty sensitive when it comes to facial products, and this is the only setting  spray I've tried that doesn't burn.  It keeps my makeup looking great for a whole day, and that's with being out doors chasing my toddler around! 

Huge bonus is that it smells so good! Some other branded sprays smell like wet dog when sprayed. 😑

Overall, I'm super happy with my purchase, so I'll definitely buy it again when I run out."
187,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray / Mini M·A·C,4,Skin Fix +,The skin fix is really amazing! When I first saw this at Mac cosmetics I just had to try it!! The spray illuminates the skin and hydrates the makeup application. The Fix+ spray applicator helps to keep the make up on pretty much all day! It's best to top the skin with a powder finish before spraying on the Fix+.
188,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray / Mini M·A·C,3,decent,"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could but 4 feels like too many. I haven't used many setting sprays before so I don't have a lot to compare this to, but I don't notice a huge difference whether I use this or not. Small differences though. Makeup still rubs off on the inside of my mask, but  overall I would say my makeup lasts a little longer than without and looks a little less cakey by the end of the day. I also like that it feels hydrating and I think that helps with avoiding cakeyness too. I like the spray nozzle a lot better than the prep and prime too-- it comes out much easier and sprays in a more even mist."
189,Fix+ Stay Over Alcohol-Free 16HR Setting Spray / Mini M·A·C,5,This spray is AMAZING,"I recently Stopped using my urban decay setting Spray because of this MAC spray! It's amazing and the mister is so refreshing. Not to mention, it literally keeps my makeup looking fresh the ENTIRE time it's on my face. It doesn't move! Whether it's a night out or walking around campus SWEATING, this spray has kept my makeup looking fresh and pretty the entire time. I have the mini right now because I was testing it out, and I will for sure purchase the large size once I finish this one."
190,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,5,Great Mascara,This mascara is easy to use and it WORKS!
191,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,4,Nice Tapered Wand,Easy to use this mascara with it's small tapered wand. Adds length to lashes.
192,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,4,NO CLUMPS AND INSANE LENGTH!,"Okay, I did not find this mascara to be more volumizing than most other volumizing mascaras in the market, but let me tell you - the length I achieved was INSANE! I don't think any other MAC formulation has given me that kind of length before, especially without the clumps. I love a lot of CoverGirl mascaras for their ability to volumize way more than this one, but almost all of those are clumpy. So i'm pretty happy with the amount of volume I'm getting here without the lumps of mascara that this 5mm fibre wand is able to achieve. Lasted all day long without flaking off onto my under eye area, so that's a plus too!"
193,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,4,Really magical,"Really like this mascara, made my lashes noticeably longer and the pigmentation was nice. I would definitely recommend this mascara."
194,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,5,Length!,"This mascara was sent to me for free by Influenster. This gives me beautiful length, separates my eye lashes so pretty. It's buildable with out making my mascara clumpy."
195,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,5,I love this!,"This was the best eyeliner I've used in a while. Not clumpy, or smelly. Didn't fall off."
196,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,5,Bold,"This mascara is fabulous. Long, bold eyelashes. Literally one layer and you can see an immediate difference. Takes subtle lashes, to stand out bold lashes without the falsies."
197,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,5,So good,This is now one of my favorite mascaras. It gives me so much length with just one coat. I only use two coats because after that I notice it can get a little clumpy. Every time I use this I get some many compliments.
198,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,4,A really great mascara,"I enjoyed working with this mascara! The formula keeps my lashes curled and doesn't feel too thick or runny. Because of my hooded lids, the brush isn't ideal for my use, but I was able to work around it. Minimal smudging/transfer to the under eye area. Overall, very well made!"
199,Magic Extension Mascara / Mini M·A·C,4,Mac mascara review,"I'm honestly not impressed with this máscara for the retail price this isn't something you need , it works and looks pretty , but it's not something I'll be buying again, it looks the same as a drug store mascara nothing wowing or amazing to say , it's really black an pigmented, need a couple of layers to make them curl , was amazing the first 3 times it was really wet and nice but after a 3 times the used the product looks clumpy,  the applicator is nice  it's okay for a Mac product . I'm not sure if it was water proof since mine smuggled after a few 8hours with this heat ."
200,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Just the best,"I LOVE this MAC Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer! This primer is moisturizing and goes on smoothly and evenly onto my skin. It leaves me with a nice, radiant glow that comes through so beautifully after 1 apply my foundation.
My makeup doesn't budge at all either. The formula is lightweight and creamy, it smells nice, and it has some skin-loving ingredients: hyaluronic acid, glycerin, olive oil, jojoba oil and vitamin E.
This is now my go-to primer, for sure."
201,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Love it,"I recommend to anyone, it does what it needs to do and I absolutely love it! I wanna buy more lol"
202,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Excellent formula,"The primer is light on the face, absorbs quickly and helps to set different makeup products very well. I tried applying the primer on some spots on my skin to see if they help the foundation to set better and cover the spots almost completely and I was pleasantly surprised! The foundation not only set very well, but the luminosity of the primer helped to hide the blemish better and give my skin a fresh and radiant touch. I also tried the primer with different shades of eyeshadow and I liked the fact that it didn't make the matte shadows shine but it did help to enhance the colors. The effect that I loved the most is that of softening the skin, I tried the first one when I was doing makeup for my mother and it helped a lot to hide some small wrinkles on her face formed around her eyes and lips."
203,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Best makeup primer you'll ever use,This is the BEST primer EVER ! It's creamy moisturizing but lightweight and makes your foundation last ALL DAY . It's got an easy to use applicator pump . I would buy this primer . I would recommend to family & friends . I recieved this for free for testing purposes .
204,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Best Primer,"This primer kept my makeup on flawlessly for twelve hours. Normally, after a while my skin messes up and this kept my skin looking perfect and feels super moisturizing immediately. Not only did it keep my makeup on for a long time but it also helped prep my skin. My skin has never looked so clear until using this product. I highly recommend!"
205,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Great,This product definitely made me shine and kept my makeup in place fantastically. My skin did not feel dry and my pores did not feel clogged. This is definitely a primer I would use on a daily basis to avoid a breakout.
206,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Smooth,"Lightweight, smooth and blend lovely in my skin. I wear it without  under makeup and works well. I would buy it again."
207,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Mac Cosmetics Studio Radiance Primer,This primer is the best I tried so far. It's helps you apply makeup on very smooth.
208,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,Hydrating and lasts all day,"I rarely stray from my go to primer (Smashbox) because when I do I'm usually disappointed. But not this time!  I may have a new favorite. This primer left my face so incredibly soft after I used it and removed my makeup at the end of the day. My face is usually pretty dry naturally so having it be so hydrating was very beneficial. I used powder foundation and it stayed on all day with primer. Even through a bit of sweat and humidity from the Texas heat. My only complaint is that it feels a little heavier than other primers when you first put it on, but the feeling does go away after a bit."
209,Studio Radiance Moisturizing + Illuminating Silky Primer,5,It works very well,I didn't use to use primer until I receive this and I loved it! Specialty in this texas heat. My makeup last longer
210,M·A·CStack Mascara,1,Panda eyes,If you want to look like a sexy panda this is the product for you. Long buildable lashes with smudges on top and bottom of your eyes. Not the look I desire.
211,M·A·CStack Mascara,3,Not for me.,"Goes on too thick. It's the brush, not the mascara. I put hashed the micro also, and it is more to my liking. Micro goes in finer because of the brush. If you like it to go on thick, then this one is for you."
212,M·A·CStack Mascara,4,Not bad,"I like that it goes on fairly fine. Wished it was just a little finer. Lashes do stay put in place when you apply it. That I like. A little pricey, but would purchase again"
213,M·A·CStack Mascara,3,Meh,"I had heard amazing things about this mascara. I like long/voluminous lashes, and I have been trying new mascaras. 
Pretty unimpressed. I found the color not as black as others & I'm not getting the length I expected (and was sworn to by the MAC Counter person."
214,M·A·CStack Mascara,4,It's ok,I do like the brush and it goes on fine but after a couple off hours it gives me panda eyes
215,M·A·CStack Mascara,5,Safe for contact lens wearers,This is very pigmented. I was so impressed that it is safe for those who are contact lenses. I would recommend.
216,M·A·CStack Mascara,1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I bought this mascara because I was told it would lengthen the appearance of my short lashes and would not flake. NOT After about an hour my face is covered in black flakes and I have to continually wipe them off and check my makeup. This is embarrassing and cumbersome. MAC missed the mark on this one. I wasted my money and got discount store product/results.
217,M·A·CStack Mascara,5,Nice fit for small handbag,Handy size.
218,M·A·CStack Mascara,5,Amazing,I am beyond impressed with this mascara. It exceeded my expectations. I have short eyelashes that tend to clump. This mascara separates my lashes and builds them up just as advertised. I even slept in it and reapplied the next day and my lashes looked wonderful. I can't thank m.a.c enough for creating my new favorite product. Great job.
219,M·A·CStack Mascara,1,Mascara,It is so dry and the brush is so tuff that it is actually painful to apply.
220,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Beautiful colors,I love how smooth these eyeshadows went on my eye. They are pretty colors for being nudes. I like the combination of shimmer and flat colors in the palette.
221,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Different Palette,This collection of neutrals has different shades than I have in other neutral palettes.  It's not the same old thing in a different package.  The shades I've used so far blended well together.  I'm looking forward to trying more eye looks!  I love the pinkish shimmer shade the most :). I always use a MAC paint pot as a primer.
222,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Great Natural Eyeshadow Palette,"This is the best eyeshadow palette that I ever owned. You can mix and match all the colors, no fall out, and color payoff is pretty good. Most importantly it looks great on my mature eyes.  Love it!"
223,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Smooth,"Very pigmented, no fall out and lasts all day even without eyeshadow primer, I recommend"
224,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Amazing,This is an amazing neutral palette.  Pigmented and blends easily.
225,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,"From demur to dramatic, this palette can do it all!","Nude palette is super. The pans of colors are bigger than the X9 palettes awhich is very generous. All the colors will suit all skin tones imo. Goes on smooth, blends easily, buildable, layer for unique colors. I found no fallout using MAC brushes, more intense color with a spray of Studio Fix on your brush. Love the shimmers! I seriously cannot find any negatives, would like to try the other new palettes as well. So many colors and easy to store or take with you (travel? YES)"
226,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Truly new and improved,"These shadows are fabulous, one swipe smooth high pigment colours that last.
Familiar favorite shades but better than before
Easy to blend and all day wear, even without 24hr Eye  Base.  Look pictured just shadows from Unfiltered Nudes Palette-no base or liner.  Shades used: Cozy Grey, Satin Taupe, Les Artiste on lid, Hidden Album to Line and Dial up the Gold to highlight."
227,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Great new collection - shades for day and night!,"I love nude shades and this has everything! There are different shades of brown, some with more yellow base and other with more rose base. I'm pretty pale and these colors don't overwhelm my skin. I like the selection and it is very easy to have a ""light"" daytime look and then add different colors to transition to a smoky, sexy evening look. Buildable and blendable colors. Glad to have this in my collection!"
228,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,Beautiful neutrals,I like this pallette because it has such a great variety of neutral eyeshadows. The eyeshadows are also easy to blend and compliment each other.
229,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Unfiltered Nudes,5,A perfect nude palette for sure,"First of all I adore the aesthetic of the packaging.  Has a huge high quality mirror. Handy for on-the-go, travel or just whenever. The MAC eyeshadow formula is one I've always enjoyed. Have quite a few singles in pro palettes. This formula really is even better than before. I had ZERO fall out. I mean none. I never mind it but I can't deny that it makes it easier for cleanup or for those who do eyeshadow after their base (y'all wild). This is one of the color schemes from the new launch I gravitated to most. A true nude palette with a mix of cool, gold and neutral undertones. AND it has 'Cozy Grey' and 'Satin Taupe'? Enough said. Two of my favorites. You can do soft natural, smokey sophisticated, or build a structure to use with another palette. The satin formula is even butterier than before somehow and still doesn't have any big glitter - just a hyper glowy sheen. Mattes are smooth and blend/build just right. Tested the palette on myself without a primer when it arrived and did a simple smokey look on one eye and a more dimensional one on the other (didn't bother doing anything to my extremely downturned lashes, just used eyeliner. Please excuse the bad quality frontal camera) and it worked great. The ochre shade is the perfect transition for the dark cool brown and a black lash-line. Photo didn't do it justice. Palette gets a 10/10 for sure."
230,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Best summer palette,"I have tried a Mac palettes before but this palette
is a dream come true, it has the perfect size to
take it everywhere. The colors blend so easy, and
also they are pigmented but not super pigmented
like the ones that you have to be very careful to
don't grab to much color. This earth tones and orange tones are perfect for my tan/caramel skin tone. My eyeshadow lasted the entire day, even
after my workout. They make my green eyes pop!
I'm in love"
231,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,I love it!!,"I love this pallette. It has gorgeous colors as well as beautiful (but sturdy and practical) packaging. The colors within this pallette can be used for everyday use or full on glam. Both the shimmers and the mattes are soft to the touch and quited pigmented. There is a bit of fallout, but I personally don't mind."
232,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Love,"I love how blendable and neutral this palette is, easy to blend and work with and has amazing color pay off, little to no fall out and easy compact to take on the go"
233,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Mac Pallets: Amazing,Its amazing I usually hate pallets because they don't cater to darker skin but this one surprisingly shows with a base of some concealer
234,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Best shadow palette,"I wear makeup often and I'm always looking for shadows that complement my complexion!! While wearing this, I received so many compliments on the colors and how well it blends together! I love this! I would buy this!!"
235,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Gorgeous,"This product was amazing, I'm always drawn to eyeshadows that have pops of color but will be disappointed with the product fallout from the brush. I felt as thought the eyeshadow was like a magnet and spread easily over my eyelid. I just hate wasting anything, so I had piece f mind knowing eyeshadow wasn't going all over the place, but right where it needed to... my eyelids. I definitely plan on buying the other palettes in this line. I will be recommending this to my friends and family."
236,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Beautiful palette!,"First of all, the package is absolutely stunning and goes in complete harmony with the colors. The colors are well-pigmented and perfect for any occasion. I love neutral looks and this palette is definitely my go-to."
237,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Great quality,"I received this palette for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I absolutely loved the packaging of this eyeshadow palette. I also loved the colors. The shades of neutral colors, dark and glittery colors give you many options. You can do full glam or go for a natural all day look."
238,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,Night out palette,Colors were amazing it's long lasting. The colors change in a perfect way once you apply them they just magically become the perfect shade for your skin tone. It's the perfect palette to be the shine from a nice dinner to cocktails with the girls.
239,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Future Flame,5,The It Palette,This palette was everything. Colors are very pigmented and last a long time. No issues with creasing.
240,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,Embedded In Burgundy Eyeshadow Palette,"I bought Embedded In Burgundy, Rose Lens, & Bronze Influencer an I love them all. However, Embedded In Burgundy is my favorite out of all 3 Connect In Color 6 pan shadows I bought. The colors just glide on and very easy to work with. I used the Embedded In Burgundy Palette on top of Layin' Low Paint Pot. It was very pretty and classy looking and can't wait to do more looks with this palette. MAC you knocked it out of the park with these 6 pan palette. These are a hit and I highly recommend them. I am NW45 in Studio Fix Powder and NC50 in Studio Fix Fluid. for reference!!!"
241,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,Sooooooooo cute!,"First off I wanna mention the packaging, it is absolutely beautiful. The shade story is beautiful I have the Embedded in Burgundy and the colors are long-lasting creamy and smooth. I didn't experience any fallout and the eye shadows were easy to blend."
242,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,Amazing Palette !! Must Have !,"This eye shadow palette is very versatile. It can be used as a highlighter too. The shade of burgundy gives such a rich, deep look to the eye making a smoky eye easily achievable. I just love how each shade compliments the other when paired and I would not even hesitate to add this to my regular glam look. 10/10 Highly recommend!"
243,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,Love itttttt,I loveeee this eye shadow palette 🎨 it's so pigmented and really last all day.
244,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,LOVED IT,"Fell inlove with this palette 😍 Usually dont wear pink but this look came out 🔥🔥🔥. Really pigmented & easy to blend , lets not talk about longlasting😍 10/10"
245,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,Gorgeous,I absolutely loved the colors and the feel of the eyeshadow! They blend well and are a very good pigment as well!
246,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,beautiful,This palette is beautiful! The shades are buildable and they feel amazing. There wasn't too much kickback and I loved the color story of the palette. You can make quite a bit of looks with the colors inside of  it. Shadows felt super buttery and loved the size of the palette as well.
247,Connect In Colour Eye Shadow Palette: Embedded in Burgundy,5,Long lasting wear,"This eyeshadow is great to work with. Very blend-able and long lasting, The colors go on your skin very pigmented for a good long lasting wear. Highly recommend."

251,Matte Lipstick / Richard Quinn,5,Lovely,"This color is perfect for spring, lasts several hours, and is in darling packaging. And on sale to boot!"
252,Matte Lipstick / Richard Quinn,5,Pop of color,I love this lipstick.  It brightens my mood whenever I wear it.
253,Matte Lipstick / Richard Quinn,5,Pop of color,I love this lipstick.  It brightens my mood when I put it on.
254,Matte Lipstick / Richard Quinn,5,Beautiful Pink,"I really loved this pink lipstick.  The color looked great on me.  It took me a while to get the lipstick, but I finally broke down.  All the colors are pretty, but this one was just lovely."
255,Matte Lipstick / Richard Quinn,5,RQ Matte Lipsticks,"When I first saw this lipstick collection, I had to get every shade it came in ( rise daydream, coral haze, mega magenta, & wamp-tastic). My favorite shade is rose daydream which I wore not only on my birthday but to take my real driver's license. Such a pretty shade. Love rose daydream and highly recommend this shade. These are comfortable mattes and don't dry out my lips like retro mattes can. Wanp-tastic is a gorgeous shade with format blush on my cheeks. For reference I am NW45 in studio fix powder plus foundation!!!"
256,Matte Lipstick / Richard Quinn,5,Beautiful Lipstick,Such a gorgeous lip colour. The packaging is everything.
257,M·A·CStack Mascara / Richard Quinn,5,Love it,"Thanks love this , feel so beautiful and the wrapping is so colorful. Great work"
258,Fix + / New Year Shine,5,Best setting spray,"I love this spray. I've tried spray after spray in search of one that truly works and doesn't change my makeup. I also like to use this to spray my eye makeup brushes before using them in eye shadow, which is extremely effective for maximizing eye shadow benefits."
259,Turquatic Jumbo,5,Amazing fragrance,What an Amazing fragrance and lasted all day long. Will buy more in future
260,Turquatic Jumbo,2,MAC Turquatic Fragrance,"The MAC Turquatic Fragrance is a fragrance that I smelled before and tried on in stores. It is a light and pleasing scent that smells clean and oceanic and very appropriate for daytime wear. I'm not sure if this has been reformulated but the scent does not last at all and it under performs  I feel that after about 30 minutes, I can hardly smell the scent on myself as well as on my clothes.  In my collection I have other fragrances that are in the same oceanic fragrance family and lasts much longer, so personally I cannot recommend this to friends and family. It's a shame because this fragrance used to last and project very well."
261,Turquatic Jumbo,3,Subtle Scent,"Very subtle scent, not overpowering. Very clean and fresh. Not long lasting at all. This would be good for a beach day."
262,Turquatic Jumbo,4,Nice summer fragrance,First time trying this perfume honestly before this i didn't know MAC have a fragrance line. It is a subtle fresh fragrance perfect for summer. I rated just 4 starts because the scent didn't last long on my skin.
263,Turquatic Jumbo,4,Fresh scent,This fragrance was a sweet and fresh scent. It is not the typical scent profile I gravitate towards but I do love a lighter fragrance for summer and I will definitely be wearing this to the beach! It seems pretty long lasting and I look forward to the smell of the ocean mixing with the perfume after a long beach day.
264,Turquatic Jumbo,5,Loved it,It was a pleasant scent that lasted throughout the day! Great for any occasion.
265,Turquatic Jumbo,5,What a fragrance....,I did not expect this sample to be the best of what I got. I wish I had a big bottle as a sample. This is one of amazing lightweight fragrance which you and your partner can use if he likes such. I purchased one for myself and yes my husband loves it.
266,Turquatic Jumbo,4,Fresh and perfect for summer!,"At first I didnt like it so much… I thought the fragrance was so strong that you couldnt even spot the different notes but as the day went by, I LOVED IT I could smell the fresh summery vibes with sweet undertones and it's perfect."
267,Turquatic Jumbo,5,Smells greats!,"The scent smells like I just stepped out of a luxurious beach! I feel like it can work for anyone, regardless of gender!"
268,Turquatic Jumbo,5,Universal scent,"I didn't know what to expect from this scent. It starts off very oceany and then gets a slight musky smell as it dries, it smells feminine but also masculine, it's divine. It's almost elemental but also kinda citrusy but it's not overpowering at all. I squirt was all I needed for my wrists and dabbed it from there to my neck."
